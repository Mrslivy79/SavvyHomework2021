    Petunias are full sun flowers. They are truly sun-babies. Which makes sense that they grow well in sunny places. These flowers are considered to be annuals. Which means they only grow for one season. They will need to be replaced every year if you want these beauties in your flowerbed each year. They come in a multitude of colors and sizes. Making for a very diverse array of gorgeousness for anyone to admire.
