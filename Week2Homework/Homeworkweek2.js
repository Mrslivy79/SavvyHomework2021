let pizzaPlace;
let numberOfToppings;

pizzaPlace = "Toastys";
numberOfToppings = 3;

Print a template literal that uses both variables to construct a short sentence about your Pizza Place.
`${pizzaPlace} is best for their ${numberOfToppings} pizzas`;

Construct an if statement that prints "Quality, not quantity." if you offer less than 10 toppings, or "A whole lot of pizza." if you offer 10 or more toppings.

Add, commit, and push your JS file to your GitHub repo.

Send your TA a link to your GitHub Homework repo when finished.
